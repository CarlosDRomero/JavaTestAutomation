# Selenium Web Automation Activity
This repository contains the code that implements web test automation to https://www.saucedemo.com/

The test suite setup is written in: [sauceSuite.xml](src/test/resources/sauceSuite.xml), **is important to run the tests from that file, because this project is using the parameters defined there**.
